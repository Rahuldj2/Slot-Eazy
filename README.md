# Presentation Management and Slot Booking System Backend
This project is built using Spring Boot to provide robust backend services for managing presentations and slot bookings.

## Overview

The Slot Booking System backend is designed to handle various functionalities including user management, organization handling, requests processing, and slot bookings. It integrates with MySQL database for data persistence and leverages Spring Data JPA for streamlined database operations.
Currently I am working to add different functionalities and api endpoints

## Features

- **User Management:** CRUD operations for users with roles such as presenter, requester, and assignee.
- **Organization Management:** CRUD operations for organizations with detailed descriptions.
- **Request Processing:** Support for direct assignments and slot-based requests with status tracking.
- **Slot Bookings:** Management of slots with booking status and venue details.
- **Advanced Queries:** Utilizes Spring Data JPA for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** Framework for creating production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies implementation of data access layer with ORM support.
- **MySQL:** Relational database for storing application data.
- **RESTful API:** Exposes endpoints for seamless integration with frontend applications.
